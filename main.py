Creating a "smart energy manager" program involves implementing predictive analytics and real-time monitoring to optimize home energy consumption. This requires gathering data from various sensors (like smart meters, thermostats, etc.), applying predictive analysis, and providing actionable insights to minimize energy usage. Here's a simplified example of such a program:

```python
import random
import time
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Error handling for missing libraries
try:
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
except ImportError as e:
    raise ImportError("Required libraries are missing. Please install pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn.") from e

class SmartEnergyManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.energy_data = pd.DataFrame(columns=['timestamp', 'power_usage'])
        self.model = LinearRegression()

    def gather_real_time_data(self):
        # Simulating real-time data gathering from sensors
        current_time = datetime.now()
        simulated_power_usage = random.uniform(0.5, 2.0)  # Dummy sensor data in kW
        self.energy_data = self.energy_data.append({'timestamp': current_time, 'power_usage': simulated_power_usage}, ignore_index=True)

    def predict_future_consumption(self):
        # Ensure there's enough data to make predictions
        if len(self.energy_data) < 10:
            print("Not enough data to make predictions.")
            return None
        
        try:
            # Preparing data for prediction
            self.energy_data['time_in_hours'] = (self.energy_data['timestamp'] - self.energy_data['timestamp'].min()).dt.total_seconds() / 3600
            X = self.energy_data[['time_in_hours']].values
            y = self.energy_data['power_usage'].values

            # Fitting the model
            self.model.fit(X, y)

            # Predicting the power usage for the next hour
            future_time_hour = X[-1] + 1
            predicted_usage = self.model.predict([[future_time_hour]])

            return predicted_usage[0]
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error in prediction: {e}")
            return None

    def optimize_energy(self):
        # Placeholder for energy optimization logic
        try:
            print("Optimizing energy consumption...")
            # Example optimization logic
            current_power_usage = self.energy_data['power_usage'].iloc[-1]
            if current_power_usage > 1.5:
                print("Consider turning off non-essential appliances to save energy.")
            else:
                print("Energy usage is optimal.")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error during optimization: {e}")

    def run(self):
        try:
            while True:
                # Gather real-time energy data
                self.gather_real_time_data()

                # Predict future consumption
                predicted = self.predict_future_consumption()
                if predicted:
                    print(f"Predicted power usage for the next hour: {predicted:.2f} kW")

                # Optimize energy usage
                self.optimize_energy()

                # Sleep for a short duration (simulating real-time loop)
                time.sleep(5)

        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            print("Smart Energy Manager stopped by user.")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    manager = SmartEnergyManager()
    manager.run()
```

### Key Aspects Covered:
1. **Real-time Data Simulation**: We simulate data collection from sensors using random numbers within a reasonable range for household power consumption.
2. **Predictive Analytics**: A simple linear regression model is used to predict future energy usage based on past data.
3. **Optimization Suggestions**: Based on current power usage, suggestions are given to save energy.
4. **Error Handling**: The program includes basic exception handling for common errors, including missing data for prediction and general runtime errors.
5. **Loop and Termination**: The program is designed to run in a loop until interrupted by the user, simulating real-time monitoring.

### Note
This is a basic representation and would need to be tailored with actual data sources, enhanced algorithms, and possibly integrated with IoT systems for practical utility.
